<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

As someone interested in Web Development and UI/UX, I think having a personal portfolio website is crucial. This website is used to show my skillset in front of prospective clients. When developing this website, I want to create a cool-looking website with some fancy animations, which I implemented using Framer Motion. I also learned how to use Sanity.io CMS to manage my project contents and Google Analytics to analyze visitor behaviors.

Currently, this website is hosted on Alibaba Cloud. Previously, I used Netlify for the React frontend and Heroku for the NodeJS backend. In the future, I will try to upgrade the UI using some 3D creations (they are cool :D) and more animations.
